					Music has fascinated me since I was very young. I remember my father would sit down at the piano in our living room and play the Peanuts theme song - the only song I ever thought he knew. The way his hands moved, the sound that was produced, it was all so elusive to me. I wanted it! My mother and sister took piano lessons with me while I was still in elementary school, but I never exceeded the beginner level material. During middle school I tried to learn the bass guitar, but quickly gave up when I found it too challenging. However, I then stumbled upon the drums with the aid of my parents, and I fell in love. I played the drums for many years off and on, and I could keep a beat without struggle. I was by no means an expert or even an advanced drummer, but I had strong fundamentals and more importantly, I really enjoyed playing.

					Fast forward about 7-10 years, and you find me in a new area of music. What happened to playing the drums? Well, I neglected the drumset I owned and I lost the drive I once had, so I sold the drumset to a friend who I knew would use it more than I was. The love for music had not faded, but the drive for the drums became clouded. At this point I gave up and figured that music just wasn't for me, or that it was too late to learn another instrument now because I was getting older, but that's when I found musical composition. I realized that I could compose songs on my computer, and the software would be able to play my compositions without struggle. This was a revelation! I could make beautiful music without the motor skills I thought I needed! And that's when the first composition, titled "Exposed," began.

					I wasn't sure how it would turn out, but I believed in my ability because I was able to compose and play a very basic song on piano a few weeks prior that sounded nice to those I showed. I spent hours on my laptop chugging away at this "experiment" that I was so fascinated by, and once it was finished, I promptly asked my peers for feedback. I like to think they were impressed that someone with no background knowledge of formal music theory or composition was able to compose a decent song, so I named the track "Exposed," as if my ability had been exposed. This was a crucial step in my journey of composition, and it feuled me to continue experimenting with what I loved, music.
