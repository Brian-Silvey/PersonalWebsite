<strong>Who I am</strong><br><br>
My name is Brian Silvey, but I go by Hiram in honor of my grandfather, and I am currently a 2nd year Computer Science major at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. This website is dedicated to work and projects relating to computer science throughout my college years.<br><br>

So far, I've completed 7 college level computer science courses, including a more hardware oriented class where we programmed an ARM microcontroller with C++ and Assembly. I've uploaded the code for a couple of projects I worked on in that class to my GitHub page.<br><br>

I've competed in 1 hackathon so far, where I wrote the code for an Arduino Rev3 to trigger events when certain patterns were clapped. This audio recognition project was the beginning to bigger ideas my college roommate and I have come up with that we hope to develope in the near future. ("Hound" on GitHub)<br><br>

After taking many computer science courses I've learned that low level systems programming fascinates me more than any other area I have dabbled in thus far. I'm currently in the process of teaching myself Rust, and I'm hoping to experiment with kernel developement on an ARM board sometime this winter break.<br><br>

<strong>My future</strong><br><br>
The semester of Spring 2015 I will be studying abroad in Seoul, South Korea at Yonsei University in Shinchon. During my high school years I made several good Korean friends, and ever since then I have been interested in the South Korean culture. At the start of my college carreer at UMass, I enrolled in an introductory Korean language class in hopes of learning more about the culture and potentially one day travelling there, myself.<br><br>
